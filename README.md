# Useful Python Scripts

This is a collection of random Python scripts that I've written to make my life easier. The only script currently in this repository is "debloat_desktop.py". 
<br/>
### debloat_desktop

This script removes unnecessary files and folders from your desktop. It moves all files and folders that have not been accessed in the last 30 days to a new folder called "Desktop Archive" on your desktop. This helps keep your desktop clean and organized.

To use this script, simply run the following command:

```python
python debloat_desktop.py
```
