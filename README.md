# Useful Python Scripts

This is a collection of random Python scripts that I've written to make my life easier. The only script currently in this repository is "debloat_desktop.py". 
<br/>
### debloat_desktop

This script removes unnecessary files and folders from your desktop and moves all the others to their respected folders. This helps a lot with cleaning out stuff. Be sure to finetune the program before running though since you don't want to lose work.

To use this script, simply run the following command:

```python
python debloat_desktop.py
```
